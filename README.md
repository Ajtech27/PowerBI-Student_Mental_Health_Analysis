# Student Mental Health Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **Student Mental Health Analysis dashboard built in Power BI** using self-reported survey data from university students.  

## Problem Statement

University students face increasing academic and social pressures that can negatively impact their mental well-being.
However, mental health challenges often go unreported or unsupported, making it difficult for institutions to design effective interventions.

This project uses self-reported survey data to explore the prevalence and patterns of mental health challenges among university students, with the goal of highlighting trends that can inform awareness and support initiatives.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Measure the prevalence of self-reported mental health issues among students  
- Analyze the distribution of depression, anxiety, and panic attack indicators  
- Understand response patterns by gender and course of study  
- Explore how academic performance (CGPA) and year of study relate to mental health challenges  
- Evaluate professional help-seeking behavior among affected students  

---

## 📊 Key KPIs (as shown on the dashboard)
- **Students Reporting Mental Health Issues:** 64%  
- **Students Reporting Depression:** 35%  
- **Students Reporting Panic Attacks:** 33%  
- **Students Reporting Anxiety:** 34%

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **64% of surveyed students reported experiencing at least one mental health challenge**, indicating a high prevalence within the dataset.  
- Among students reporting mental health issues:
  - **35% reported depression**
  - **34% reported anxiety**
  - **33% reported panic attacks**
- Only **6% of affected students sought professional treatment**, suggesting significant barriers to help-seeking.  
- Female students recorded higher response counts across most courses and timestamps, indicating greater openness to self-reporting mental health concerns.  
- Students within higher CGPA ranges (**3.0–4.0**) showed a higher proportion of reported mental health challenges, suggesting academic pressure may be associated with mental strain.  
- Mental health issues were most prevalent among **first-year students (25%)**, with a steady decline in later years, and the lowest prevalence among final-year students (2%).

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Introduce targeted mental health awareness and support programs for **first-year students**.  
- Improve accessibility and visibility of **professional counseling services** to address the low treatment-seeking rate.  
- Promote stigma-reduction initiatives that encourage students to seek help without fear of judgment.  
- Provide academic stress-management programs, particularly for **high-performing students** experiencing pressure.  
- Use survey data continuously to monitor mental health trends and guide student support interventions.
